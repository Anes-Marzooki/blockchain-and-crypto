### What is a blockchain ?

It's a distributed and decentralized *ledger* (record) that stores data, that is shared publicly across all the nodes or its network.

```
Block {
	Data:['data01', 'data2',...],
	Hash: 'xd0jk002...',
	previousHash: 'previous-hash'
}
```
> The `previousHash` key, links the blocks together creating a chain of blocks.
